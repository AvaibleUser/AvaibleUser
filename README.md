# Hi, I'm Dylan

I'm a **Backend Developer** with about a year of professional experience, focused on building scalable services and understanding how things work under the hood—from system architecture to deployment.

### What I've been doing lately:

- **Java & Spring Boot:** Building microservices and handling data persistence with PostgreSQL.
- **Cloud & DevOps:** Containerizing apps with Docker and deploying to GCP (Cloud Run, GKE) and AWS (EC2, S3).
- **Architecture:** Focusing on layered patterns while exploring Event-Driven systems (Kafka) and DDD.
- **Frontend:** Building functional, reactive UIs with Angular and TypeScript when the project needs it.
